# Timeseries and LSTM
Neural networks have been criticized for being a "black box" of sorts, where the features that may be critical in the network's learning and evaluating functions are not clear to the user and are hidden in the network's weights. Our novel approach Integrated Evolutionary Learning provides an automated method for simultaneously accomplishing principled feature selection and hyperparameter tuning while furnishing interpretable models where the original features used to make predictions may be obtained and ranked in order of importance, even in deep learning with artificial neural networks. In this approach, the machine learning algorithm of choice is nested inside an evolutionary algorithm which selects features and hyperparameters over generations on the basis of an information function to converge on an optimal solution.

These programs extend previous work on two-dimensional data (subjects with features) to three-dimensions (subjects with features recorded at successive time intervals) using an LSTM network to predict medical conditions and find important features relevant to those conditions.
